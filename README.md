# Oklahoma City Thunder NBA Schedule Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project explores how the NBA schedule impacts Oklahoma City Thunder’s performance 
throughout the season. Beyond descriptive analysis, the project also applies **feature engineering 
and predictive modeling** to identify the key factors (travel, rest days, back-to-backs, 
time zone changes) influencing team performance and win rates.

The analysis also includes a comparison with the **Denver Nuggets** for the 2024–25 season.

## 🚀 Key Insights
- Identified how **back-to-back games and travel distances** affect Thunder’s win probabilities.  
- Mapped **time zone changes and travel intensity**, showing potential schedule disadvantages.  
- Compared OKC’s 2024–25 schedule preview with Denver’s, revealing differences in rest and travel.
